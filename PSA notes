DEVOPS TOOLS 

i) maven
In java we cannot deploy project directly on server instead jar file is deoloyed 
In intellij,maven clean , after click install it will generate jar file in target folder .

ii) Sonarqube -->
-used for reviewing the code and find the bugs 
-automate process for reviewing

iii) Jfrog and nexus --> maintain the versions of project like project versions / java versions / jar files

iv) Terraform --> automates creation of ec2 /server

v) Grafanana and prometheous : used for monitoring of hardware 

Prometheus: Collects & stores metrics data & Grafana: Displays that data with beautiful dashboards.
Prometheus captures metrics data like:
-CPU usage
-Memory usage
-Request counts
-Error rates
-Application-specific metrics (e.g., order count in an e-commerce app)
-It scrapes metrics from applications exposing metrics via HTTP endpoints (like /metrics).

vi) ELK (Elastic search , Logstash , Kibana)  used for monitoring of software logs

vii) Kubernetes :- helps to manage docker images

viii) docker :-

ix) NGINX :- 
NGINX is open source software that powers web servers and enables reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, and media streaming. 
It was originally designed as a web server with high performance and reliability.

In one line:
👉 It receives requests from users and forwards them to your application efficiently.

🧠 Simple Example: Ticket Counter
Without NGINX  =======>

Everyone directly crowds your Spring Boot app.
Your app = 1 ticket counter → gets overloaded → slow or crashes.

With NGINX  ==============>

NGINX = smart security guard who:

Organizes the line
Sends people one by one
Blocks bad requests
Caches repeated answers
Handles static files (images, JS, CSS)
Distributes load to multiple app instances
Your app now handles only the real work.

⭐ Key Benefits in 1 Line Each
✔ 1. Caching
If 100 users ask the same thing → NGINX replies instantly from cache → your app handles only 1 request instead of 100.

✔ 2. Load balancing
NGINX can send requests to multiple Spring Boot instances → more users supported.

✔ 3. Security
Blocks strange, slow, or malicious requests before they hit your Spring app.

✔ 4. Static files
NGINX serves CSS/JS/images 10x faster than Spring Boot.

✔ 5. Reverse Proxy
Makes your app hide behind port 80 → user-friendly URL:


http://yourserver

instead of:
http://yourserver:8080
