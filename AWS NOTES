<=======================================  AWS ============================================> 

A) EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) ====>
Virtual servers in the cloud.
Scalable computing capacity.
Users can provision, manage, and terminate instances as needed.

1. AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
A template used to create EC2 instances.
Includes OS, applications, and settings.

2. Key Pair
A secure way to access EC2 instances.
Consists of a public key (stored by AWS) and a private key (kept by the user).
used to connect local system to ec2 server/instances

3. Security Groups
-Virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances.
-can restrict which urls will be allowed and which would be restricted

4. EBS :- Elastic Block Store
-Durable block storage for EC2 instances.
-can increase volume once storage gets exceeded
-snapshots ==> immediate copies 

5.loadbalancer :-

6.Autoscaling :-
-Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to demand.
--for eg :- in flipkart,autoscaling increases size of server to 1000 during sales time and reduces size of server to 100/200 after sale gets end.

B) s3 :- for storage --> images,video, 

C) RDS :- for mysql,PostgreSQL database

D) Dynamo DB :- for NoSQL database

E) IAM ( Identtity & Access management ):- 
- create subaccounts with restrictions for users .
- users will have limited access to permitted services
--Manages users and their permissions to AWS resources securely.

iam , vpc , elastic beanstalk, cloud watch, sns , aws lambdas, efs ecs , eks , routes3 , cloud front

F) vpc( virtual private cloud) :-
same as IP address
Like your own little network with walls—you decide who gets in and out.

🔐 Example: You run sensitive apps inside a VPC so the public can’t access them directly.

G) elastic beanstalk:-
-use to automate the process like ec2 all configurations will be done
-- billing will be continuos even if you are not using app at night. 
=Think of it like a chef who cooks your app.
=You just give your code (e.g., a Python or Java app), and Elastic Beanstalk sets everything up—servers, storage, scaling—for you.

🧑‍🍳 Example: You upload your website code, and it runs on the internet without you touching servers.


F) aws lambda:- 
- similar to elastic'
- here, it is pay as you use ; for eg: - how much request you get in your server that much billling will be generated

G) cloudwatch :- 
- if servers load get 90-95 % it will give alert to admin of app /user 
--used for monitoring purpose 
-Monitoring service for AWS resources and applications, offering logging and alerts.
📊 Example: Your website gets super slow—CloudWatch can alert you and show why.

H) SNS (Simple Notification Service) :-
-Pub/sub messaging service for sending notifications and messages between services.

Practical 

----------------------------------------
2ND LEC
1) 
Before creating ec2 instance/VM for any OS port opening should be done first for ssh otherwise u will get connection timed out error.
STEPS for creation of port :- security groups --> inbound rules --> add port and allow any ipv4 address
Linux ssh :- 22 port 
windows :-3389 -->u will get username and pass as well from which you should connect it

one key pair can connect multiple servers/ec2 consoles.

2) Every server/vm has 2 ips :- private and public
pubilc IP gets changes every time server gets restart so to avoid this use "elastic IP" 
STEPS :- 
below security groups --> Elastic ip -->
Associate the instance in elastic ip so you will see now public ip will remain static now
