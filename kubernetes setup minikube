prerequisite for minikube :- docker desktop 

Note :- once done installing if u want to start minikube first login to your docker desktop and then minikube start then only your cluster will gets started ...

1) download .exe and then install it . 
path C:\Program Files\Kubernetes\Minikube  //by default gets installed here after installing from clicking .exe

check version :- minikube version --> minikube version: v1.37.0

2) open powershell and run as administrator and type below command :
minikube start

minikube cluster gets created with all controller manager, api server,...

3) Type below commands now:- 
minikube kubectl -- get pods -A   //it will install latest kubectl which is already inside minkube

OR

kubectl get pods -A

It runs kubectl (built into Minikube) and shows all pods.

output :-

4) To see worker nodes:- 
kubectl get nodes

NAME       STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
minikube   Ready    control-plane   3d10h   v1.34.0

5) 
1️⃣ Stop the Minikube cluster
minikube stop

Why?
This shuts down the Kubernetes VM/container so it stops using CPU/RAM.

2️⃣ (Optional) Completely delete the cluster
minikube delete

6) minikube dashboard creation :- 
--->
minikube dashboard
