Docker notes

Suppose u built app on windows server and try to deploy on linux server there will be compatibility and portability issue if not configured properly

Docker is run in Linux server instead of local system bcoz it takes more storage

So ,if we create docker file and run it anywhere it will 100% run as there will be not compatiblity and portability issue

Multiple servers Rr4 there in production so we can't change environment for each and every server like eg. Java 18 in one env and Java 21 in one env. 
So docker comes here and these docker files will help to change in multiple servers so don't need to worry about anything

25: architecture Linux vm --> ec2 instance amazon

29. : Kernel acts as bridge between linux  and hardware/software ...
        Eg. If we type something on keyboard it goes to kernel first and then it will send to linux.
        Kernel helps to manage hardware,software...

34:- gives diagram to explain
- ec2 is created with linux  
- linux OS --> docker engine --> docker container (isolated environment)
-Docker engine acts as bridge here now between linux and docker container.
 on top of this docker container have been created and required software are installed.
 • Docker container/ ONE ISOLATED DOCKER CONTAINER has required environments setup like java mysql and appcode so it will get run by linux OS
• Linux OS helps to run these container 
• now same container can be run in diff server or ec2 instance so no compatibility issue will be there


Docker file/container contains
Appcode --> jar file of java project
+ Download Dependencies (same like pom.xml)

In spring boot project docker file created in root folder


44 pe diagram dekh samjh jayega 
Docker file ---> {build} ---> docker image (contains replica of what included in file)
---> {store the image into} --->  docker hub (list of images stored here) ---> 
{Pull the image from hub} ---> after pulling container will be created in linux server.




Pros of docker:- 
• Portability = once u create a container in which softwares like java 8,mysql installed ,it will now run into any OS .
• installation = helps to install / upgrade any software in multiple no. Of servers.
