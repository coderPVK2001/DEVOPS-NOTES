Installation steps :-

32:52 :: Terraform

Why Terraform used? 
-->
Suppose we want to create infra for testing server so we will make replica of Dev server , after that same replica for UAT , preprod and Prod.
So by doing it manually we will use terraform where with only same script we can build full infra.
If we want to build new Project then also it will be useful for full setup of infra we can build it with help of these previous scripts.

+++52:22 ::

At 8 IAM creation

At 33 create instance ec2 

Steps :- in 43 architecture is there

-in vs code create main.tf file for terraform

-now for connecting cloud services like aws/google cloud first define provider block

Note:- search in cpt provider block+ secret key + access key for aws --> Define IAM user as well and create role with admin access permissions --> will get access key and secret key


IMP++++

- after writing code/hcl type below commands:- 

*1) for installing packages written inside provider block and generates terraform.lock.hcl file which contains plugins details ->
Terraform init 

*2) for validating configurations ->
Terraform validate

*3) for recorrecting format /indentations ->
Terraform fmt 

*4)Generating plan document  -->
 Terraform plan
//Which contains project details stored in form of json inside terraform.tfstate file

*5) saves plan document in tplan file so u can use this same in other projects/env. 
Terraform plan -out=tplan 

*6)Generates JSON structure and genrates resources in aws ->
Terraform apply 

+++ 28 ::: Practical

1) Create a folder for each env uat,dev,prod

In uat create provider.tf,.... 
In prod same

2) To access in terminal :-

Right click to folder(uat) --> open in integrated terminal --> start typing commands
Create input variable for passing values for Ami , instance type, ...

Steps in short for terraform:- init(for starting plugin connection only) --> plan --> apply

Note :- create diff files for diff thing 

Eg:- 
provider.tf for plugin,
Input.tf for variable setting,
main.tf for resources

13 se dekh

Tag name :- instance name if creating aws instance and in resources we are mentioning logical name to find it easily
