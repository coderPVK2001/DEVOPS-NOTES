<====================== LINUX  NOTES ==========================>

For practising in linux ways:-
i)	Insatall linux OS 
ii)	Use oracle virtual box on chrome 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
iii)	Use aws ec2 instance ( connect local system to aws linux server using ssh client)
Go to ec2 service  AMI (linux )  instance type (t2.micro free tier) (750 hours free one month)    create key pair ( add name  type RSA  fomat .pem   click create key pair)   allow SSH traffic check the tickbox   LAUNCH INSTANCe

Note :- don’t forget to close ec2 

Downloaded .pes/key pair  file store it in folder and add in C/D drive 

Open git bash on that file

In instances of aws you should click connect using ssh and add 3rd  point(it will alter the file permissions in system) command and last point command in git bash .  

Type yes  yes next  now will connect to server



Linux commands :-

Note :- linux is opensource so everyone modifies it and launches their own OS 
For eg: - kali linux, aws linux,   redhat linux,…

Whoami  to see current user logged in

Pwd  --> current working directory

Mkdir  --> make directory 

Ls --> listing folders

Ls -r --> rev order

Ls -l --> (long listing) for detailed folder details in asc order 

Ls -lr --> In rev order

Ls -la --> will give all hidden folders as well

Rmdir “foldername” --> remove empty folder only 

Cd ~ --> to return to root folder 

Cd .. --> to take one folder back

Clear 

rmdir -rf "folder name"  ==> recursively forcabely remove folder even if content present in it

rm 'filename' ==> for deleting particular file

touch "filename"  ==> creates new file

---------------- MOVE OR RENAME --------------------------

mv ==> used to rename or move the file
mv 'old filename' 'new filename'  ==> rename
mv 'filename' 'full path'   ==> moving the file to another location

-------------   CREATE READ WRITE --------------------------

cat ==> used to create, write or read the file 

cat 'filename' --> display content
cat >  'filename'   & click ctrl +C  ==> will create new file
cat >> 'filename'  & start writing content & after finished writing click ctrl +C  ==> will help to write content inside file

cat -n 'filename'  ==> will display content with line no.s 

Note:- for duplicate filename, cat file will fully replace the old file and old content will be vanished whereas  
                    while using touch file wont gets fully replaced instead it will only change/update the time of creation

tac 'filename'  ==> will display content in rev order

--------------------- COPY CONTENTS --------------------------

cp 'old filename' 'new filename' ==> for copying files from one file to another file

cat 'filename1' 'filename2' > 'filename3'   ==> copying 2 files and merging it into single file

----------------------- HEAD TAIL -------------------------------

head 'filenam' --> prints first 10 lines 
head -(number) 'filename'         --> print only given no of lines 
head -n -(number) 'filename' 
  
tail 'filenaem' --> prints last 10 lines 

------------------- SEARCHING ----------------------------------------\

GREP ( Global Regular Expression) 

NOTE :-
-grep is case sensitive
-order of -i -n doesn't matter here
-you can use it at the end also it will work

grep 'search anything' 'filename'  --> it is case sensitive so will search only that much matching words

grep -i 'anything' 'filename'      --> for removing case sensitivity and searching

grep -i -n 'anything' 'filename'   --> for searching with line number as well

grep -i -n 'anything' 'filename' * --> for searching word/char in all files in current directory

grep -i -n -v 'anything' 'filename' --> for searching other than matching word/char // same as not operator (-v )

Q. If you want to saarch from only first 5 lines of one file if there are 100s of lines of code 
-->
head -5 'filename' | grep 'anything' -i -n    
Note:- above  | called as pipe 

----------------------WORD COUNT ------------------------------------------------

wc 'filename'     --> will give output in [lines] [words] [bytes/chars] filename

wc -l 'filename'  --> to fetch only lines

wc -w 'filename'  --> to fetch only words

wc -m 'filename'  --> to fetch only chars/bytes


==========================EDITOR =============================================

#### VI EDITOR ######

vi 'filename'  --> will create new file in editor (in linux notepad calle as editor)

for editing inside file press 'i' mode ==> INSERT mode
click esc for coming out of insert mode

:wq              --> for save and quit


###### SED EDITOR ####################

SED stands for Stream Editor.

-It is primarily used for text processing (substitution, deletion, printing, and insertion).
-Allows performing operations on files without opening them.
-A highly versatile and powerful command in Linux.

SED Operations

<========== Substitution ========>

1. Replace the first occurrence of the keyword hello with welcome:

sed 's/hello/welcome/' 'filename'

2. Replace the second occurrence of the keyword hello with welcome:

sed 's/hello/welcome/2' 'filename'

4. Replace all occurrences of the keyword hello with welcome:

sed 's/hello/welcome/g' 'filename'

5. Substitute and save changes directly into the original file:

sed -i 's/ho11.0/welcome/g' 'filename'

<============ Deletion =============>

1. Delete the 1st line of a file:

sed -i '1d' 'filename'

2. Delete the fourth line of a file:

sed -i '4d' 'filename'

3. Delete the last line of a file:

sed -i '$d' 'filename'

4. Delete the content from 2nd to 6th line

sed -i '2,6d' 'filename'

5. Delete all the content from file

sed -i '1,$d' 'filename'
